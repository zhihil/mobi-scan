# Modelling
## Overview
This is the notebook used to develop the Convolutional Neural Network that powers Mobi-Scan.

## Setup
This notebook can be run with Google Colab, a browser-based platform for running Jupyter notebooks with GPU support.

Unfortunately, I don't have a GPU on my desktop, so I cannot guarantee if this will run properly on a local setup.
